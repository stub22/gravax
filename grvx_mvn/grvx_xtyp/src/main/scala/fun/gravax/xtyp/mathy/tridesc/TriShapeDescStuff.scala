Let's "Tri" again!

A TriShape is a fully realized (euclidean plane) shape with measure.
It has side-lengths, angles, perimeter, and area, which are all (exact) Real numbers.
A TriShape must be able to supply these numbers in a form suitable for calculation.

The 8 numbers of the triangle are related by numerous equations.
A TriShape must satisfy all these equations, or else it should not be constructable.
Relations involving angles depend on trigonometric functions.

For an angle which, measured in degrees, is a multiple of three, the exact trigonometric values of the
sine and the cosine may be expressed in terms of square roots. These values of the sine and the cosine
may thus be constructed by ruler and compass.

For an angle of an integer number of degrees, the sine and the cosine may be expressed in terms of square roots
and the cube root of a non-real complex number. Galois theory allows a proof that, if the angle is not a multiple
of 3Â°, non-real cube roots are unavoidable.

For an angle which, expressed in degrees, is a rational number, the sine and the cosine are algebraic numbers,
which may be expressed in terms of nth roots. This results from the fact that the Galois groups of the cyclotomic
polynomials are cyclic.

For an angle which, expressed in degrees, is not a rational number, then either the angle or both the sine and the
cosine are transcendental numbers. This is a corollary of Baker's theorem, proved in 1966.
