/**
 * All Unique Triangle Shapes
 * The space of all equivalence-classes of similar triangles may be parameterized by 2 or more real-ish numbers,
 * which may be treated as a tuple of real-ish nums, as a (constrained) complex num, or as a (constrained) vector.
 * In order to describe a valid triangle, the nums must satisfy bounds criteria on some numeric functions.
 * Moduli Spaces are a general theory of these parameter spaces.
 * Searching "Moduli Space of Similar Triangles" will give plenty of help, here are a few free & semi-free links to improve on:
