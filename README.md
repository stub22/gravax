# gravax
Scratchpad Scala project containing mathematical computing experiments

* Streams of randomly generated data, e.g. triangles, with randomness isolated into effects
* Histograms (fed from streams) coded using immutable data structures
  * Monoidally combinable, allowing for parallel construction
* Code experiments using Typelevel libraries:  FS-2, Cats-Effect, Spire
